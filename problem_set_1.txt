4. When Taylor and I tried to push a change at the same time, it first gave Taylor a long error message. When she tried pushing again, Github Desktop told her to pull the repo before pushing because it had been modified. Taylor then pulled the repo and resolved the conflicts by merging our changes and pushed the changes.
